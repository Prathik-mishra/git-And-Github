what is git? 
git is a VCS (version control system) where developers can contribute together etc..,

what is github?
it is like a google drive where we save our codes and can share with other people to have a look at it.

//steps:



we can write git commands in any terminal 
* git --version;

to check the current version of git in our system.

* git init

initialises a empty git repository in current folder location example c/user/path/....

* git status 

it tells us about what is the status of the file that have be changed.
we can use this command as many times as we want because it just return the files status

* git add .

it add all the files in the repository.
after doing this all the files will appear green when we check the git status.

* git commit -m

we can also write it as git commit -m "A COMMIT MESSAGE"

* git log

shows the history of commits we have performed 

* git checkout -> commit id <-

* git checkout main 

* git remote add origin -> repo link <-

* git push origin main

to push the code on the github repo 

* git pull origin main 
to get the code from the github repo
